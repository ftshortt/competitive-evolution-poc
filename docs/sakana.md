# Sakana AI Integration

## Overview

This framework is designed to integrate with [Sakana AI's](https://sakana.ai/) evolutionary model discovery and adaptive reasoning approaches. The competitive evolution architecture provides a foundation for implementing Sakana-style workflows including model merging, evolutionary optimization, and emergent capability discovery.

## Architectural Alignment

The Competitive Evolution POC shares several key principles with Sakana AI's research:

### Evolutionary Computation
- **Population-based search**: Dual-pool architecture maintains diverse solution populations
- **Fitness-driven selection**: Automated evaluation and selection pressure drives optimization
- **Mutation and crossover**: Variation operators enable exploration of solution space
- **Competitive dynamics**: Multi-pool setup enables co-evolution and competitive pressure

### Model Evolution Support
- **Weight merging capabilities**: Architecture supports model weight combination workflows
- **Adaptive reasoning patterns**: Framework can discover and evolve reasoning strategies
- **Cross-domain transfer**: Multi-domain entity system enables knowledge transfer across problem types
- **Lineage tracking**: Neo4j graph database maintains full evolutionary history

## Current Capabilities

### Code Evolution (Current Implementation)
The POC currently focuses on evolving code solutions:
- LLM-generated code variations (DeepSeek-R1 vs Qwen2.5-Coder)
- Fitness evaluation through test execution
- Graph-based lineage tracking
- Real-time performance monitoring

### Multi-Domain Support (Phase 2)
Extensible to multiple knowledge domains:
- Code, behavior, physics, society, and custom domains
- Cross-domain relationship mapping
- Domain-specific fitness functions
- Transfer learning across domains

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Interactive selection and review
- Guided evolution with human feedback
- Manual intervention points for exploration

## Planned Sakana Integrations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
âœ… Evolutionary framework with fitness evaluation  
âœ… Multi-pool competitive setup  
âœ… Lineage and relationship tracking  
âœ… Multi-domain entity support  

### Phase 2: Model Evolution Scaffolding
ðŸ”„ Model weight evolution workflows  
ðŸ”„ Merge strategy experimentation  
ðŸ”„ Adaptive reasoning pattern discovery  
ðŸ”„ Automated capability emergence detection  

### Phase 3: Advanced Sakana Features
ðŸ“‹ Integration with Sakana's published frameworks  
ðŸ“‹ Automated model discovery pipelines  
ðŸ“‹ Large-scale evolutionary search  
ðŸ“‹ Production model deployment workflows  

## Integration Scaffolding

### Placeholder: Sakana Module Structure

A future `src/sakana/` module structure is proposed:

```
src/sakana/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ merge.py              # Model merging strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ evolution.py          # Evolutionary algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptive_reasoning.py # Adaptive reasoning patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ discovery.py          # Automated capability discovery
â””â”€â”€ evaluation.py         # Sakana-specific fitness functions
```

This structure will provide:
- Clean separation of Sakana-specific logic
- Extensibility for new Sakana research implementations
- Integration points with existing competitive evolution framework

## Technical Requirements

To support Sakana AI integrations, the following infrastructure is in place or planned:

### Current Infrastructure
- âœ… vLLM for efficient inference
- âœ… Neo4j for relationship tracking
- âœ… PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- âœ… Grafana/Prometheus for observability
- âœ… Celery for distributed task processing

### Planned Additions
- ðŸ”„ Model weight storage and versioning
- ðŸ”„ Merge operation primitives
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced fitness evaluation for model-level evolution
- ðŸ”„ Sakana API integrations (if/when available)
