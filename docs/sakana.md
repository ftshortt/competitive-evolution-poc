# Sakana AI Integration

## Overview

This framework is designed to integrate with [Sakana AI's](https://sakana.ai/) evolutionary model discovery and adaptive reasoning approaches. The competitive evolution architecture provides a foundation for implementing Sakana-style workflows including model merging, evolutionary optimization, and emergent capability discovery.

## Architectural Alignment

The EvoAgent shares several key principles with Sakana AI's research:

### Evolutionary Computation

- **Population-based search**: Dual-pool architecture maintains diverse solution populations
- **Fitness-driven selection**: Automated evaluation and selection pressure drives optimization
- **Mutation and crossover**: Variation operators enable exploration of solution space
- **Competitive dynamics**: Multi-pool setup enables co-evolution and competitive pressure

### Model Evolution Support

- **Weight merging capabilities**: Architecture supports model weight combination workflows
- **Adaptive reasoning patterns**: Framework can discover and evolve reasoning strategies
- **Cross-domain transfer**: Multi-domain entity system enables knowledge transfer across problem types
- **Lineage tracking**: Neo4j graph database maintains full evolutionary history

## Current Capabilities

### Code Evolution (Current Implementation)

The EvoAgent currently focuses on evolving code solutions:

- LLM-generated code variations (DeepSeek-R1 vs Qwen2.5-Coder)
- Fitness evaluation through test execution
- Graph-based lineage tracking
- Real-time performance monitoring

### Multi-Domain Support (Phase 2)

Extensible to multiple knowledge domains:

- Code, behavior, physics, society, and custom domains
- Cross-domain relationship mapping
- Domain-specific fitness functions
- Transfer learning across domains

### Human-in-the-Loop

- Interactive selection and review
- Guided evolution with human feedback
- Manual intervention points for exploration

## Planned Sakana Integrations

ðŸ“‹ Automated model discovery pipelines  
ðŸ“‹ Large-scale evolutionary search  
ðŸ“‹ Production model deployment workflows  

## Integration Scaffolding

### Placeholder: Sakana Module Structure

A future `src/sakana/` module structure is proposed:

```
src/sakana/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ merge.py              # Model merging strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ evolution.py          # Evolutionary algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptive_reasoning.py # Adaptive reasoning patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ discovery.py          # Automated capability discovery
â””â”€â”€ evaluation.py         # Sakana-specific fitness functions
```

Current stub implementation exists at `src/sakana/__init__.py` for future expansion.

### Placeholder: Merge Strategies

Proposed merge functions for model weight combination:

```python
def merge_spherical_linear(model_a, model_b, alpha=0.5):
    """SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation) for model weights."""
    pass

def merge_task_arithmetic(model_a, model_b, task_vector):
    """Task arithmetic-based model merging."""
    pass

def merge_ties(models, density=0.2):
    """TIES (Trim, Elect Sign, Merge) strategy."""
    pass
```

### Placeholder: Adaptive Reasoning Patterns

```python
def discover_reasoning_patterns(solutions, min_fitness=0.8):
    """Extract common patterns from high-fitness solutions."""
    pass

def apply_reasoning_pattern(pattern, new_problem):
    """Apply discovered reasoning pattern to new problem."""
    pass
```

## Usage Examples

### Current: Code Evolution

```python
from src.utils import Neo4jLineageTracker, Task

tracker = Neo4jLineageTracker()
task = Task(domain="code", description="Sort array efficiently")

# Evolution happens via LLM pools
result = await evolve_solution(task)
```

### Future: Model Evolution

```python
from src.sakana import merge_spherical_linear, discover_reasoning_patterns

# Merge models with evolutionary search
merged_model = merge_spherical_linear(model_a, model_b, alpha=0.7)

# Discover patterns from successful solutions
patterns = discover_reasoning_patterns(high_fitness_solutions)
```

## Performance Monitoring

Sakana-related metrics are exposed via:

- **Prometheus**: Merge operation timings, pattern discovery stats
- **Grafana**: Evolutionary search dashboards
- **Neo4j**: Model lineage and capability graphs
