Sakana AI Integration Module

This module provides integration points for Sakana AI's evolutionary frameworks
and adaptive reasoning approaches. It serves as a scaffolding for future
integrations with Sakana's model evolution, merging, and discovery workflows.

Phases:
- Phase 1 (Current): Foundation scaffolding and documentation
- Phase 2 (Planned): Model evolution workflows and merge strategies
- Phase 3 (Future): Advanced Sakana features and published framework integrations

For detailed information, see docs/sakana.md
