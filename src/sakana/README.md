# Sakana AI Integration Module

## Overview

This module provides scaffolding and integration points for [Sakana AI's](https://sakana.ai/) evolutionary frameworks and adaptive reasoning approaches. The EvoAgent is designed to support Sakana-style workflows including model merging, evolutionary optimization, and emergent capability discovery.

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Current)

- ✅ Module structure scaffolding
- ✅ Documentation and integration roadmap
- ✅ Architectural alignment with evolutionary computation principles

## Planned Modules

### `merge.py`

Model weight merging strategies and combination workflows for Sakana-style model evolution.

### `evolution.py`

Evolutionary algorithms and optimization strategies adapted from Sakana's research approaches.

### `adaptive_reasoning.py`

Adaptive reasoning pattern discovery and dynamic strategy selection mechanisms.

### `discovery.py`

Automated capability emergence detection and discovery workflows.

### `evaluation.py`

Sakana-specific fitness functions and evaluation metrics for model evolution.

## Quick Reference

For comprehensive integration details, see:

- **Integration Roadmap**: [docs/sakana.md](../../docs/sakana.md)
- **Main README**: [README.md](../../README.md)

## Usage (Future)

```python
# Example usage when modules are implemented
from src.sakana import ModelMerger, EvolutionaryOptimizer

# Initialize Sakana-style model evolution
merger = ModelMerger(strategy="evolutionary")
optimizer = EvolutionaryOptimizer(fitness_fn=custom_fitness)

# Run evolutionary model discovery
result = optimizer.evolve(
    population_size=10,
    generations=100,
    merger=merger
)
```

- Fitness function design for model evolution
- Integration with Sakana's published frameworks

## Architecture Integration

This module integrates with the existing EvoAgent framework:

- **Dual-Pool Evolution**: Leverages existing competitive pool architecture
- **Neo4j Lineage**: Tracks model evolution and merge history
- **vLLM Inference**: Efficient model serving for evaluation
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Enables cross-domain knowledge transfer
