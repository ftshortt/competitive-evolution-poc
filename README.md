# EvoAgent

## What is EvoAgent?

Imagine if Darwin's theory of evolution could be applied to AI agents in real-time. That's EvoAgent.

**For newcomers**: EvoAgent is like a digital ecosystem where AI agents compete, learn, and evolve automatically—just like species in nature. The weak agents die out, the strong ones survive and reproduce, and over time you get incredibly capable AI that adapts to any challenge.

**For technical users**: EvoAgent is an evolutionary multi-agent framework built on AS-FDVM (Adaptive Search - Fractal Darwinian Virtual Machines) architecture. It implements competitive evolution, mutation-based adaptation, and fitness-driven selection to create self-improving agent populations.

## How It Works: Evolution in Action

### The Core Mechanism

1. **Agent Population**: Start with multiple AI agents (like different "species")
2. **Competitive Tasks**: Agents compete on real challenges and problems  
3. **Natural Selection**: Best-performing agents survive and "reproduce"
4. **Mutation & Evolution**: Offspring agents inherit traits with random variations
5. **Continuous Adaptation**: The cycle repeats, constantly improving capabilities

### Key Components

- **Evolving Graph Memory**: Each agent maintains a living knowledge graph that grows smarter over time—not just remembering facts, but building interconnected understanding
- **Competitive Agent Mixing**: Multiple agents don't just compete—they also collaborate when it benefits survival, creating emergent team strategies
- **Lineage Tracking**: Full genealogy for every agent—trace any breakthrough back through its evolutionary ancestry to understand how it emerged
- **Cross-Domain Adaptation**: Agents that excel in one domain automatically apply learned strategies to completely different problems

## What Makes EvoAgent Uniquely Valuable

### 🤖 **AI-Generated & AZR-Powered**
- Built entirely through AI collaboration (Comet Browser AI + ChatGPT + Gemini)
- Powered by battle-tested AZR (Absolute-Zero-Reasoner) infrastructure 
- Proven FSDP+QLoRA foundations for production reliability
- Zero hand-coding means rapid iteration and experimental freedom

### 🌍 **Accessible Yet Powerful**
- Simple conceptual model (evolution) that anyone can understand
- Production-ready infrastructure that scales from laptop to data center
- Cross-domain applicability—works for research, business problems, creative tasks
- Built-in experiment tracking and reproducible results

### 🧪 **Open for Bold Experiments**
- Want to evolve agents for creative writing? Go for it.
- Curious about multi-agent financial trading strategies? Experiment away.
- Interested in collaborative problem-solving? The framework adapts.
- Academic research on emergence? Perfect platform.

### 🚀 **Beyond Traditional AI**
- **No manual training**: Set conditions, let evolution do the work
- **Emergent capabilities**: Agents develop unexpected skills you never programmed
- **Self-improving systems**: Performance increases automatically over time
- **Swarm intelligence**: Individual agents become collectively brilliant

## AZR-Derived Best Practices and Production Features

The following capabilities were integrated by adapting Absolute-Zero-Reasoner (AZR) best practices to EvoAgent:

### 1) Robust FSDP+QLoRA Wrapper for Fine-tuning (OCR, R1, Qwen)
- Freeze → Inject → Wrap sequence ensuring FSDP/QLoRA compatibility
- 4-bit quantization with nf4 + bfloat16 compute for memory efficiency
- Frequent checkpointing and safe adapter-only saves
- Distributed initialization with LOCAL_RANK handling

**Code Structure:**
- `src/fsdp_qlora_wrapper.py` - Core training wrapper
- `create_ocr_agent()` - OCR-specialized agents
- `create_r1_agent()` - Reasoning-focused agents  
- `create_qwen_agent()` - General-purpose conversation agents

**Usage Example (Multi-GPU):**
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=NUM_GPUS -m src.agent_orchestrator
```

### 2) Cyclical/Auto-stopping Orchestration Pipeline
- Cyclic training/evolution loops with intelligent stopping
- Auto-stop on max steps, max runtime, or convergence detection
- Graceful checkpointing at cycle boundaries
- Resume capability from any evolution checkpoint

### 3) Artifact Management and Lineage Tracking
- Comprehensive evolution history storage
- Automatic performance metrics collection
- Agent genealogy and trait inheritance tracking
- Experiment reproducibility and comparison tools

### 4) Production Deployment Ready
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Kubernetes deployment configurations
- Monitoring and alerting integrations
- Scalable infrastructure patterns
